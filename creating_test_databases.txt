1.  Create a test database (TestADO or something like that)  (I haven't included this because it would probably be different for everyone)
2.  Create a user named test_login with access to the database
3.  Run the table and stored procedure create script
4.  Run the insert statements to populate the table
5.  Grant select on Person and execute on the 2 stored procedures to test_login.
6.  If you're going to test NT Authentication, make sure you have the rights in #5 with your windows login

You'll obviously need to adjust the test scripts to use your server name (or instance or filename) and also the name of the database you created.
